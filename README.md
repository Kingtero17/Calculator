<p align="center">Note: For this challenge the "val()" method was used. We do not recommend its for professional applications, projects or pages for the following reasons:</p>

* With eval(), malicious code can be executed inside your application without permission.

* With eval(), third-party code can see the scope of your application, which can lead to potential attacks.


<p align="center">The eval() method evaluates or executes an argument. If the argument is an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, eval() executes the statements.</p>
